These are my .dotfiles.
There are many like them, but these ones are mine.

## Install guide

1. Clone it into `~`
2. Run `install.sh`

If you're not me, you may want to configure `~/.dotfiles/secret/.gitconfig` to
look a little something like this:

```
[user]
  name  = Marty McFly
  email = mmcfly@hillvalley.edu
```

If you're me, you know that already.
